### Side Projects

There are several side projects with active development. 

* SignalR integration and the ability to update the viewmodel from the server side.
* Translation of C# methods in viewmodels into JavaScript (implemented, pending merge).
* Flex-based layouting control (implemented, will be added as a commercial product).
* [DotVVM Dynamic Data](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-dynamic-data)

### Future

We also plan to replace Knockout JS by some vdom based alternative library [#383](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm/issues/383). 
We have a working prototype and we expect this to be available later in 2018.
Knockout JS will still be supported for compatibility reasons, but the controls included in the framework will not need it. 

### Commercial Products
